Map Border Detection

Overview
Map Border Detection is a project designed to detect and outline the borders of countries, states, or other regions in map images. This tool can be used for a variety of applications, such as geographic analysis, automated cartography, and map-based data visualization.

Features
Automatic Border Detection: Identify and outline borders in various types of map images.
Customizable Detection Parameters: Adjust sensitivity and accuracy to meet different requirements.
Supports Multiple Image Formats: Works with common image formats like JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.
Export Results: Export the detected borders as image overlays or vector files (e.g., SVG, GeoJSON).
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: (e.g., OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.)
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Cloning the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/map-border-detection.git
cd map-border-detection
Usage
Command Line Interface (CLI)
To run the map border detection from the command line:

bash
Copy code
python detect_borders.py --input path/to/map_image.png --output path/to/output_image.png --sensitivity 0.8
Parameters
--input: Path to the input map image.
--output: Path to save the output image with detected borders.
--sensitivity: (Optional) Detection sensitivity (default: 0.8).
Example
bash
Copy code
python detect_borders.py --input example_map.png --output detected_borders.png --sensitivity 0.9
Jupyter Notebook
You can also explore and modify the detection algorithm using the provided Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook map_border_detection.ipynb
Algorithm Description
The border detection algorithm combines edge detection techniques (e.g., Canny edge detection) with contour detection to identify the borders in map images. The algorithm is further refined using morphological operations to improve accuracy.

Workflow:
Preprocessing: The input image is preprocessed by converting it to grayscale and applying Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
Edge Detection: The preprocessed image is processed using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
Contour Detection: Contours are detected from the edges, and irrelevant contours are filtered out.
Post-processing: The detected borders are refined and highlighted on the original map.
